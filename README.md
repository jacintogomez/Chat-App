# Chat App

To run project, run `ChatServer.java` and also `ChatClient.java` at the same time. Multiple `ChatClient.java` windows can be opened at the same time.

This is a server-client chat setup with Java. Once the server is started a user can create multiple client windows, and whatever text is typed in those windows will appear in all other chat client windows as well.
